Part of the code was developed from the following resources:
- Assignment developed in Part 1

Accessories:
- Arduino
- TFT display

Wiring instructions:

TFT Display:
    The display pins are numbered left to right in this document when they are being viewed
    with their labels showing rightside up. Note you do not require the touchscreen for this assignment,
    so it is probably a lot easier to not wire the Y+/X+/Y-/X- pins.

    Display Pin     Arduino Mega Pin
    1 GND           BB GND bus
    2 Vin           BB Vcc (+ive) bus

    4 CLK           Pin 52
    5 MISO          Pin 50
    6 MOSI          Pin 51
    7 CS            Pin 10
    8 D/C           Pin 9

    19 CCS          Pin 6

Zoom in and out buttons:
    Button          Arduino Mega Pin
    Zoom In         Pin 2
    Zoom Out        Pin 3

Joystick connections:
    Joystick Pin    Arduino Mega Pin
    +5v             Vcc
    GND             GND
    VRx             Analog 1
    VRy             Analog 0
    SW              Pin 8


How to run code:
- Type into terminal the client file and then 'make upload' to run client
- Open up a new terminal and open a new directory fro the server. Type "python3 server.py" to run server

How to run the Route-finder program:
- Pick any point on the map using the joystick
- The buttons are for to zoom in and zoom out of the map
- Pick a second location for your destination
- After this the the Arduino will say "Recieving Waypoints"
- When the program is finished running the Arduino should display a route.

Files (External) Used to Run server.py:
- graph.py (class implementation of Graph class)
- binary_heap.py (class implementation of BinaryHeap)

Files (External) Used to Run client.py:
- consts_and_types.h
- lcd_image.cpp
- lcd_image.h
- Makefile
- map_drawing.cpp
- map_drawing.h

Description:
Continuing form Assignment 1 Part 1, we implemented the Arduino side of the assignment which were
to modify the server from part 1 so that it can communicate over the serial port and
augment the provided Arduino client program so that it sends a request to the route
finding server and draws a route.

Misc:
- Will sometimes timeout so please restart program and re-upload
- We did not finish the drawing function but to prove that we were able to get the waypoints we printed
the points onto the serial monitor.
