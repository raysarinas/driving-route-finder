Description:
This program is a basic version of route finding for the Edmonton map. In this program,
it will print in the terminal the latitudes and longitudes that the user must take
in order to get from their chosen start latitude/longitude to their end location.
In the program, it implements Dijkstra's Algorithm which gives the shortest path
based on the time it takes to travel through the waypoints.
